- TODO's marked all around in the source files.
- Relate irregular causatives, such as kalk->kaldır to their root forms.
- Derivational morphemes need review
- Postpositions 
- Apostrophe insertion does not currently comply with official spelling
  rules.
- <acr> is not analyzed
- Mark auxiliary verbs like ol/bulun.
- Mark verbs for transitivity.
- Mark verbs for (typical) cases their indirect objects take.
- Handling of reduplication is less than acceptable. We have a
  lexicon, Redup, with a few non-wrod reduplication pieces, like
  'maşkım'. However, 
        (1) ideally these items should be tokenized together with the
            previous word: e.g., 'aşkım maşkım'
        (2) They should be allowed to inflect (the entry should be
            something like 'aşk maşk<n>').

- compound noun roots does not really need the <ncomp> tag. First, it
  is not very informative. Second, the compounds in the lexicon
  without -(s)I is not marked. The marking in the lexicon is for 
  internal use rather than specifying a subclass.
- Use a more natural lexical representation for compound noun roots.
  Now, we require the -(s)I at the end to be removed, which can be
  done by xfst rules just fine.
- lexical class <cnjsub> is somewhat related to <cv_arak> (e.g., in
  olarak).
- için <cnjcoo> ??
