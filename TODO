- Handling of reduplication is less than acceptable. We have a
  lexicon, Redup, with a few non-wrod reduplication pieces, like
  'maşkım'. However, 
        (1) ideally these items should be tokenized together with the
            previous word: e.g., 'aşkım maşkım'
        (2) They should be allowed to inflect (the entry should be
            something like 'aşk maşk<n>').

- Use a more natural lexical representation for compound noun roots.
  Now, we require the -(s)I at the end to be removed, which can be
  done by xfst rules just fine.
