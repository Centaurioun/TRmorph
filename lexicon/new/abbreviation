! 
! The words listed below belong to different classes.  The peculiarity
! for any of these abbreviations are the forms of suffixes attached to
! them, and  whether they require an apostrophe after them or not.
! 
! According to official rules, an abbreviation in all capitals should
! inflect the way the abbreviation is pronounced (not the way the long
! form is pronounced). So, the correct form is "KDV'ye", not "KDV'ne".
! In some cases the official rule and the common use is different,
! particularly for abbreviations that end with a `K', where it is common
! to read it as 'ka' not 'ke', as a result, it is probably more common
! to find "PKK'ya" compared to "PKK'ye".
! 
! On the other hand, the suffixes after abbreviations in lower case
! letters should follow the way the long-form is pronounced. The correct
! form is "gr'a" and "kg'dan", but not "gr'ye" or "kg'den".
! 
! As a result, to correctly recognize the abbreviated forms, we need
! some additional information in the lexicon. We add 'silent' letters
! which are dropped from both analysis and surface levels, but used for
! phonological alternations like vowel harmony, or buffer
! insertion/deletion. These 'silent' letters are
! 
!     - ^sBUV     Back unrounded vowel (aı)
!     - ^sBRV     Back rounded vowel (ou)
!     - ^sFUV     Back unrounded vowel (ei)
!     - ^sFRV     Back rounded vowel (öü)
!     - ^sVC      Voiced consonant
!     - ^sUC      Voiceless consonant
! 
! Most abbreviations are pronounced with a final `e', as a result, if an
! abbreviation does not have any silent letters following it, and if
! there are no vowels in the abbreviation, a ^sFUV is inserted during
! morphophonological process. So, one does not need to add a ^sFUV after
! abbreviations like "TBMM" or "KDV", or "ASELSAN". However, this also
! makes it necessary to ad ^sVC^sFUV for cases like "AB" where despite 
! the vowel the abbreviations is pronounced as a sequence of letters.
