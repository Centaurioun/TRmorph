The source lexicon is now maintained as YAML files. At the top level,
a lexicon file is a mapping (or dictionary) where the key is the
headword. Each lexical "entry" is also a mapping where the following
top level keys are recognized:

- 'class' is a mapping from continuation classes defined in
  morphological description to class-specific settings. The value of a
  of a key in class is another mapping which allows all keys of the
  top level entry except for 'class', and some class-specific keys
  described below. For example, the entry for a simple entry for word
  'yüz' which can be a noun, a verb or a number should be similar to
  the following. 

    yüz:
        class:
            N:
            V: {flags: [aorAr]}
            Num:

- 'feat' is a list of additional features of the lexical item.
  Features are class specific, and should be listed under the class
  definition (rather than at the top level). The continuation class
  for the lexc lexicon will be the combination of class, features, and
  the some of the flags. The class specific 'features' are listed
  below:
        - Prn:
            - Pers: personal
            - Dem: demonstrative
            - Rfl: reflexive
            - Loc: locative
            - 1s,2s,3s,1p,2p,3p the person/number agreement of the
              pronoun.

- 'notes' are a list of free-form notes. It is not used by TRmorph
  lexicon construction, but may be useful for other purposes.

- 'flags' contain a set of flags that affects the final lexicon
  definition (the word form and the continuation class) in TRmorph
  lexicon. The class-specific flags should be defined under the
  relevant class, top level flags should be used for general flags for
  the headword. Here is an inventory of the flags in use:
    - 'nonstd': non-standard use, should be avoided in a strict written
      language, e.g., in a spell checker. Ideally, the standard form
      should be specified with the top-level key 'stdForm'.
    - 'boundRoot': the root form is bound, it needs to be inflected to
      be a word. This is currently is not used directly.
    - 'fsd' final stop devoicing. The final stop in the headword is
      devoiced when it precedes a suffix starting a consonant or if it
      is in the bare form (or, one can see this as 'voicing', as the
      base form of the form will include a devoiced consonant).
    - 'fsdOpt' the final stop devoicing is optional, some speakers do
      it some do not. This option will result in two entries in the
      lexc lexicon and the lexical items with this flag will always be
      analyzed with and without (de)voicing.
    - 'aorAr', aorist for of the verb takes -Ar form of the suffix.
      This flag is part of the lexc continuation class definition.

- 'stress' indicates the location of exceptional stress. This
  should only be used if the root form has exceptional stress. Roots
  with regular, final stress should not be marked. Otherwise, the
  inflected forms will have wrong stress marking in g2p conversion.

- 'stdForm' lists the standard form of the given non-standard
  word.

- 'source' a list that indicates the source(s) of the lexical entry.
  This does not necessarily indicate actual source, but a resource
  that the entry is present. If the entry is checked on multiple 
  sources, the list lists them all. The source marking is currently
  scarce, and not used for the analyzer. It can, in principle, be used
  for building a more or less reliable lexicon. The following are
