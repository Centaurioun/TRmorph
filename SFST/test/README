Test cases in this direcotry requires `expect'.

The files that start with a number are considered to contain lines
similar to:

A:A:eve:ev<n><dat>
A:R:eva:ev<n><dat>
G:A:ev<n><dat>:eve
G:R:ev<n><dat>:eva


The first field (seperated with colon `:') tells whether test is valid
for analysis (A) or generation (G). The second field instructs whether
the test-expect pair is good and should be accepted (A) or bad and
rejected (R). The third field is the string to test, and the fourth
field is string to expect (or not to expect for R).
