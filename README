This is the README file for TRmorph hfst/lexc branch (updated 2012-09)

TRmorph is a open source/free morphological analyzer for Turkish. The
current version is a complete rewrite of the (earlier) SFST version of
TRmorph using xfst/lexc. Although it should do at least as good as the
SFST version, this version is not tested as much and documentation is
in progress.

TRmorph compiles with foma[1]. Although not tested yet, it should be
trivial to compile it using HFST tools as well (only possible hurdle
is fixed-length reduplication that uses _eq()).
